# Versioning Strategy

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) for tracking changes and releases.

## Version Format

Versions are defined as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

1.  **MAJOR** version: Incremented when there are significant, incompatible UI/UX overhauls, major architectural shifts, or breaking changes to the project structure.
2.  **MINOR** version: Incremented when new features, sections (e.g., a new case study, a new interactive component), or significant enhancements are added in a backwards-compatible manner.
3.  **PATCH** version: Incremented for minor design tweaks, bug fixes, performance optimizations, or content updates (e.g., fixing a typo or updating a project description).

## Change Management

- Every release should be accompanied by a tag in the version control system (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0`).
- Major changes should be documented in a `CHANGELOG.md` file (if applicable).

## Current Status

The current version of the portfolio is tracked in the repository tags.

- **Initial Release:** v1.0.0
